## Summary
Create a barebone GNOME application template that serves as a starting point for multiple GNOME applications. The template will integrate core GNOME technologies (GTK4, LibAdwaita, ATK, Blueprint, Vala, Meson) and include flatpak packaging configuration for runtime version 49.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Vala (latest stable), C (GTK4 bindings)
**Primary Dependencies**: GTK4, LibAdwaita, ATK, Blueprint, Meson (build system)
**Storage**: N/A (template project)
**Testing**: Meson test framework, manual verification
**Target Platform**: Linux (GNOME desktop environment)
**Project Type**: single (template generation project)
**Performance Goals**: Fast template instantiation, minimal resource usage
**Constraints**: Must work with flatpak runtime 49, GNOME HIG compliance
**Scale/Scope**: Template for multiple application types, reusable structure

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Template Constitution Placeholder**: The constitution file contains only template placeholders and needs to be customized for this project. No specific constitutional requirements are currently defined, so proceeding with standard software development practices.

**Initial Assessment**: PASS - No constitutional violations for template project
**Post-Design Assessment**: PASS - Design maintains simplicity and follows standard patterns

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (single project) - This is a template generation project, not a web or mobile application.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
✅ **COMPLETED** - All unknowns from Technical Context resolved

**Research Tasks Completed**:
1. ✅ GNOME Technologies Stack → GTK4 + LibAdwaita + Vala + Meson selected
2. ✅ Flatpak Runtime Version → org.gnome.Platform//49 confirmed
3. ✅ Blueprint Integration → Declarative UI approach chosen
4. ✅ ATK Integration → Accessibility examples included
5. ✅ Template Structure → Cookiecutter-style approach selected
6. ✅ Build System → Meson + Ninja confirmed
7. ✅ Testing Strategy → Meson unit tests + Integration tests
8. ✅ Documentation → Markdown + Meson integration

**Output**: research.md with all technology decisions documented and justified

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
✅ **COMPLETED** - All design artifacts generated

**Completed Deliverables**:
1. ✅ **data-model.md**: Template configuration, file structures, variable system
2. ✅ **contracts/template-api.md**: CLI interface, file system contracts, build requirements
3. ✅ **contracts/generated-project.md**: Application structure, desktop integration, testing
4. ✅ **quickstart.md**: Prerequisites, usage examples, troubleshooting
5. ✅ **CLAUDE.md**: Agent context file with project overview and current state

**Key Design Decisions**:
- CLI interface: `gnome-template create/validate/list`
- Variable syntax: `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` format
- Template structure: Cookiecutter-style with .tmpl files
- Generated project structure: Standard GNOME application layout
- Build validation: Meson compile + desktop file validation + flatpak build

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- CLI implementation tasks from template-api.md contract
- Template file creation tasks from data-model.md entities
- Validation system tasks from generated-project.md contract
- Documentation and example tasks from quickstart.md

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Core templates before CLI before validation
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent template files)

**Estimated Task Categories**:
1. **Template System** (8-10 tasks): Template parser, variable substitution, file generation
2. **CLI Interface** (6-8 tasks): Command parsing, user input validation, output formatting
3. **Validation System** (4-6 tasks): Template validation, generated project testing
4. **Documentation** (3-4 tasks): User guides, API documentation, examples
5. **Testing Framework** (5-7 tasks): Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end validation

**Estimated Output**: 25-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - this section intentionally left empty*

No complexity deviations requiring justification. The template generation approach follows standard software patterns and maintains simplicity.

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
