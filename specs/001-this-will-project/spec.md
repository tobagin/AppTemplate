# Feature Specification: GNOME Application Template Project

**Feature Branch**: `001-this-will-project`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "this will project will serve as barebone application starting point for multiples GNOME applications built using GNOME Technologies and packaged as flatpak!"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Description provides clear intent for application template
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: developers creating GNOME applications
   � Actions: provide starting point, use GNOME technologies, package as flatpak
   � Data: application template structure, configuration files
   � Constraints: GNOME technologies, flatpak packaging
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific GNOME technologies to include]
   � [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: minimum viable application features]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flow: developer uses template to start new GNOME app
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement focuses on template capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Template structure, configuration files, build system
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding specific technologies"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT developers need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to quickly start building a new GNOME application without setting up the entire project structure from scratch. They need a template that provides the essential foundation with GNOME technologies already configured and ready for flatpak packaging.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer wants to create a new GNOME application, **When** they use this template, **Then** they get a working base application with GNOME technologies integrated
2. **Given** a developer has customized the template for their needs, **When** they build the application, **Then** it successfully packages as a flatpak
3. **Given** multiple developers want to create different GNOME applications, **When** they each use this template, **Then** they can independently develop their applications with consistent foundational structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when developers need to add technologies not included in the template?
- How does the template handle different types of GNOME applications (desktop apps, system tools, utilities)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Template MUST provide a minimal working GNOME application structure
- **FR-002**: Template MUST include configuration for flatpak packaging
- **FR-003**: Template MUST integrate core GNOME technologies GTK4, LibAdwaita, ATK, Blueprint, Vala, Meson.
- **FR-004**: Template MUST allow developers to easily customize and extend the base application
- **FR-005**: Template MUST include build system configuration for GNOME applications
- **FR-006**: Template MUST provide documentation on how to use and customize it
- **FR-007**: Template MUST support flatpak-runtime version 49.
- **FR-008**: Template MUST include basic application metadata and desktop integration files

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Application Template**: Core project structure with source files, build configuration, and packaging setup
- **Configuration Files**: Flatpak manifest, desktop files, and GNOME-specific configuration
- **Build System**: Files and scripts needed to compile and package the application
- **Documentation**: Instructions and examples for developers using the template
